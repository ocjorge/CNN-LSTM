A hybrid CNN-LSTM model for sEMG-based gesture recognition using the NinaPro DB1 dataset.

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a deep learning pipeline for surface electromyography (sEMG) signal classification using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. The model is trained on the [NinaPro DB1 dataset](http://ninapro.hevs.ch/) to recognize hand gestures from EMG signals.

## ✨ Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines CNN's feature extraction with LSTM's temporal modeling
- **Data Preprocessing**: Sliding window approach with Z-score normalization
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of data loading, preprocessing, and model building
- **Visualization**: Training history and performance metrics plotting

## 📊 Dataset

The model uses the [NinaPro DB1 dataset](http://ninapro.hevs.ch/) which contains:
- 27 healthy subjects
- 52 hand gestures + rest position
- 10 EMG electrodes at 100Hz sampling rate

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emg-gesture-recognition.git
cd emg-gesture-recognition
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 Usage
Download the NinaPro DB1 dataset and place it in the ninapro_db1_data folder
Run the main script:

``` python
python emg_gesture_recognition.py
Configuration Options
Modify these parameters in the script:

```python
# --- Data parameters ---
SUBJECT_ID = 1                     # Subject to process (1-27)
EXERCISES_TO_PROCESS = [1, 2, 3]   # Exercises to include

# --- Preprocessing ---
WINDOW_SIZE = 200                  # Window length in samples (~200ms at 100Hz)
STEP = 50                          # Window step size

# --- Training ---
EPOCHS = 30
BATCH_SIZE = 128
VALIDATION_SPLIT = 0.2
📈 Results
Example performance on Subject 1 (Exercises 1-3):

Metric	Training	Validation
Accuracy	92.4%	85.7%
Loss	0.21	0.48
